                <p class="gdText">Golden Dragon has been a beloved part of my community for over 30 years, a place where tradition meets innovation in every dish. What started as a small family kitchen has become a local favorite for authentic Chinese cuisine made with heart and heritage.</p>
                <p class="gdText">I've been part of this journey since middle school, working as a young chef, greeting customers, and learning what it means to truly connect with people through food. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to step up when we were short-staffed, doing everything I could to keep our business afloat during a time where many businesses failed.</p>
                <p class="gdText">That experience has been nothing short of amazing, as it not only has taught me what it takes to run a successful business but also the beauty of building connections within your community. This sparked my motivation to further elevate our my parents' business by utilizing my technical skills to build and design our first official website. Our old Facebook page simply wasn't enough, it limited access to those who did not use Facebook and made it hard for customers who wanted to view our menu. Below is our old Facebook page.</p>

                <p class="gdText" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">From my discussions with a wide variety of customers, I was able to identify three target points that this website had to address:</p>
                <ol class="gdProblemsList">
                    <li><b>Digital Menus Are Common–but Often Frustrating</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>91% of respondents had used online or digital menus at restaurants.</li>
                            <li>While customers appreciated the convenience, many shared frustration with outdated PDFs, confusing layouts, or slow-loading content–highlighting a need for a cleaner, faster, and more user-friendly experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Simpler Ordering Enhances the Experience</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>82% prefer being able to conveniently order through their phone rather than coming in to order.</li>
                            <li>Users appreciate the speed and autonomy but emphasize frustration with inconsistent systems and payment flows.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Over two-thirds of respondents said they'd be more likely to visit a restaurant if the website was more eye-catching as it typically the first impression a customer has of a restaurant.</li>
                            <li>This revealed a huge creative opportunity for me to bring a lot of creativity and aesthetics to our website, to differentiate it from other restaurant's websites around the area.</li>

                <hr class="gdDivider">
                <p class="gdText">Based on insights gathered from user interviews, our restaurant attracts a wide range of customers, spanning different age groups and dining preferences. This diversity led me to develop two user personas to better understand and address the unique needs of our core user segments. The first persona represents socially driven, convenience-seeking college students who frequently dine out with friends. While the second persona captures the older demographic, who tend to prioritize a more traditional dining experience.</p>

                <p class="gdText">I began by visualizing the customer journey, how a family-run restaurant could welcome both loyal regulars and first-time visitors online. These early sketches helped clarify what mattered most: making the menu easy to browse, simplifying online orders, and ensuring guests could quickly find contact information or directions. By mapping out both mobile and desktop layouts, I was able to prioritize a welcoming, accessible experience that reflects the heart of Golden Dragon.</p>

                    This project pushed me to become a more thoughtful and well-rounded designer. I leaned into technical skills, using auto-layout, grids, and careful structure to make every screen feel consistent and intentional. Prototyping the Golden Dragon website helped me think through real user flows, anticipating how someone might explore the menu or connect with the restaurant's story. Most importantly, I found myself focusing more on design thinking: looking for small details to improve, asking why each element mattered, and always considering the user's experience first. The results were tangible as well: within the first three months of launch, the site saw an approximate <b>40% increase in traffic</b> and a nearly <b>53% boost in profile interaction rates</b>, reflecting stronger user engagement and interest. This process has made me more curious, more detail-oriented, and more excited to keep growing with every new challenge.
