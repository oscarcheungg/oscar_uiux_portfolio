                <p class="gdText">Golden Dragon has been a beloved part of my community for over 30 years, a place where tradition meets innovation in every dish. What started as a small family kitchen has become a local favorite for authentic Chinese cuisine made with heart and heritage. The experience of learning the back to the front of the ktichen and persevering through difficult times, such as COVID-19, has been nothing short of amazing.</p>
                <p class="gdText">In this project, my motivation was to further elevate my parents' business by combining my technical and design skills to redesign our official website. To give more context, our very first ever "website" was our old Facebook page which simply wasn't enough, it limited access to those who did not use Facebook and made it hard for customers who wanted to view our menu. My parents' restaurant actually ended up being my final project for a web design class that I took at UNC, in which I worked in a team of 3 to fully build and design a proper website for Golden Dragon. </p>

                <p class="gdText">In designing and developing the first version of Golden Dragon’s website, my team and I created a functional foundation for the restaurant’s online presence. However, as the site was tested and used over time, I began to notice key UI and UX issues, such as accessibility concerns, inconsistent visual hierarchy, and friction in the customer journey. These insights highlighted the need for a redesign focused on improving clarity, usability, and overall customer experience.</p>

                            <li>“Menu” button feels dominant while “Contact” fades, creating an unbalanced hierarchy.</li>

                <p class="gdText" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">From my discussions with a wide variety of customers, I was able to identify three target points that this website had to address:</p>
                <ol class="gdProblemsList">
                    <li><b>Digital Menus Are Common–but Often Frustrating</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>91% of respondents had used online or digital menus at restaurants.</li>
                            <li>While customers appreciated the convenience, many shared frustration with outdated PDFs, confusing layouts, or slow-loading content–highlighting a need for a cleaner, faster, and more user-friendly experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Simpler Ordering Enhances the Experience</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>82% prefer being able to conveniently order through their phone rather than coming in to order.</li>
                            <li>Users appreciate the speed and autonomy but emphasize frustration with inconsistent systems and payment flows.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Over two-thirds of respondents said they'd be more likely to visit a restaurant if the website was more eye-catching as it typically the first impression a customer has of a restaurant.</li>
                            <li>This revealed a huge creative opportunity for me to bring a lot of creativity and aesthetics to our website, to differentiate it from other restaurant's websites around the area.</li>

                <hr class="gdDivider">
                <p class="gdText">Based on insights gathered from user interviews, our restaurant attracts a wide range of customers, spanning different age groups and dining preferences. This diversity led me to develop two user personas to better understand and address the unique needs of our core user segments. The first persona represents socially driven, convenience-seeking college students who frequently dine out with friends. While the second persona captures the older demographic, who tend to prioritize a more traditional dining experience.</p>

By mapping out both mobile and desktop layouts, I was able to prioritize a welcoming, accessible experience that reflects the heart of Golden Dragon.</p>

                    The redesigned Golden Dragon homepage creates a cleaner, more user-friendly experience compared to the original version. By replacing the busy background image with a minimal layout and bold typography, the content is easier to read and more accessible. Playful illustrations add personality while reinforcing the restaurant’s cultural identity. Navigation is simplified with clear links and a prominent “Order Now” button, reducing friction for users who want to take quick action. With these design choices, it improves overall clarity, strengthen brand presence, and provide a more seamless entry point into the customer journey.

                    An “About” section was added to the Golden Dragon website to share the restaurant’s heritage and strengthen its connection with customers. The clean layout pairs storytelling with visuals, allowing visitors to learn about the restaurant’s history, values, and community roots. Thoughtful typography and cultural design accents enhance authenticity, while imagery brings the narrative to life. By adding this section, the website goes beyond function, creating a more personal and engaging experience that builds trust and loyalty with customers.

                    The redesigned menu presents dishes in a clean grid with vibrant images and clear pricing, making browsing easier and more engaging. The streamlined layout improves scannability and creates a modern, inviting look. A new DoorDash promotion was also added, giving customers a direct way to order delivery and enhancing convenience.

                    The testimonials section highlights authentic customer feedback, building trust and credibility for new visitors. Reviews are displayed prominently with a clean layout, making it easy for users to connect with real dining experiences. This strengthens the restaurant’s reputation and fosters a sense of community. Unlike the original version, the contact form was intentionally left out in favor of featuring the restaurant’s phone number in the footer, allowing customers to call directly. This decision focuses the experience, reducing unnecessary steps and aligning with user expectations for quick and direct communication.

                    This project pushed me to become a more thoughtful and well-rounded designer. I leaned into technical skills, using auto-layout, grids, and careful structure to make every screen feel consistent and intentional. Prototyping the Golden Dragon website helped me think through real user flows, anticipating how someone might explore the menu or connect with the restaurant's story. Most importantly, I found myself focusing more on design thinking: looking for small details to improve, asking why each element mattered, and always considering the user's experience first. The results were tangible as well: within the first three months of launch, the site saw an approximate <b>40% increase in traffic</b>, a nearly <b>53% boost in profile interaction rates</b>, and a <b>20% increase in orders</b>, reflecting stronger user engagement and conversion. This process has made me more curious, more detail-oriented, and more excited to keep growing with every new challenge!
