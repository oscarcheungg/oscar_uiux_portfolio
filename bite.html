                <p class="biteText">Inspired by QR code dining culture in China, Bite reimagines the restaurant experience by blending social discovery with seamless ordering. Instead of endless reviews from strangers, users share bite-sized dish recs and photos with friends—helping each other decide what to eat, not just where.</p>
                <p class="biteText">Scan a QR code at partner restaurants to instantly access the menu, place an order, and earn rewards—all without disrupting existing POS systems. Bite also highlights trending dishes and spots using real-time social data, making dining out more fun, personal, and rewarding.</p>
                <p class="biteText">Bite transforms eating out into a connected, curated experience—driven by taste, tech, and the people you trust.</p>

            <hr class="biteDivider">
            <p class="biteText">Diving into the Bite project was both a challenge and a joy—especially as someone with a genuine passion for food and the experiences it creates. Designing for a social dining audience let me blend my love for food with my drive to solve real problems, pushing me to think beyond features and focus on real connections and seamless experiences. Navigating the end-to-end design process—from research and ideation to final prototypes—was not only rewarding, but also deeply personal, as I considered how I could help improve the food industry for others who share my enthusiasm. I find fulfillment in building a personal connection to my work, sharing my process openly, and ensuring that empathy—not bias—guides every decision. This journey has strengthened my commitment to meaningful, user-centered product design and to fostering genuine connections between people and the products they use.</p>
